As a user I wanted:

-The minimum viable product of Bushra’s cafe app is to have the functionalities of switch between menus and to select specific options depending on the users requirements. E.g.If a customer would like to make a new order, it creates a processing system.

February 14/02/2023:

- collection of products and couriers DONE
- customer able to make new order DONE
- Update order status - DONE
- Exit app, data persisted DONE
- Start app, load persisted data DONE
- Tested DONE

-The code works by defining global variables, which are available inside and outside of functions and local variables as it is only recognisable inside the region in which it is created.

-The majority of my variables are global scopes as they are called numerous times. I have faced a few problems where I made a variable locally and was not able to call it outside of its function, this led to me printing the same list under different variable definitions. E.g. ‘orders’ is a global variable.

-I then persisted by data (data persistence) to ensure no data is lost (append data into existing file). After I moved on to building my app with nested menus and logical clear flow.

-I used numerous conditional statements, this helps with skipping unnecessary sections of the menu and lists. 

-Unit testing – code that test other code I will isolate my code into another py file then add it to my final code
